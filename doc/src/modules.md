# Modules

Right now the only module that ship with adios is a partial reimplementation of [`treefmt-nix`](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt-nix).
This module is a great place to start to get an idea for how to work with adios modules.

I ([@adisbladis](https://github.com/adisbladis/)) use adios in my private configuration repository with even more modules defined, but they are too highly custom to me to be suitable for inclusion.
